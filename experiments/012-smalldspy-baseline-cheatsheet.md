# 012 — SmallDSPy paired baseline and forced-50 cheatsheet screen

## Objective and status

Measure two fast iteration signals on the user-selected SmallDSPy slice:

1. no-note baseline lenient expertise (WAUC); and
2. newly studied forced-50 cheatsheet lenient expertise (WAUC).

Generation and local grading are separate phases. Episodes, grades, reports,
and the paired comparison are immutable JSON artifacts. The primary two-number
summary is the local-Qwen pure weighted-rubric lenient WAUC for each arm; the
four budget-level means, token costs, compile diagnostics, uncertainty, and
paired deltas remain mandatory context.

Status: implementation and infrastructure preflight complete; outcome-bearing
generation has not started and results are pending.

## What this dataset is—and is not

`data/smalldspy.jsonl` contains five records with SHA-256
`b152153a9ec159dc99f89d9a1ca085a88d04be818b348e58cebf620513b2c75d`:

| question ID | full DSPy row | topic |
|---|---:|---|
| `dspy_2de37073e8e4` | 11 | `react_agents_and_tools` |
| `dspy_7329144ef1e9` | 12 | `react_agents_and_tools` |
| `dspy_a5b116f00083` | 13 | `react_agents_and_tools` |
| `dspy_e175093485fd` | 14 | `react_agents_and_tools` |
| `dspy_0b4b420ebeb4` | 15 | `react_agents_and_tools` |

The parsed objects are exact copies of those public `data/dspy.jsonl` rows.
Together they contain 26 weighted claims and 25 evidence spans. Every excerpt
was re-matched byte-for-byte to the pinned Git blobs, all rubric weights sum to
100, and all five reference programs execute successfully against pinned DSPy.

This is **not an independent held-out test**. The questions and rubrics are
public, the slice was chosen adaptively after inspecting the benchmark and
source layout, all five questions share one topic, and repository history
already contains 1,080 rollout artifacts and 963 grade artifacts for these IDs.
The screen can debug plumbing and compare variants on this narrow slice; it
cannot establish general DSPy performance, out-of-sample improvement, or a
publishable studying result. Repeated use makes it a development set.

The exact upstream rows also retain three inherited audit limitations rather
than silently changing the evaluation after selection:

- `dspy_e175093485fd` asks for an exactly one-step router, while its gold demo
  exposes a caller-controlled `route_budget` whose default is one;
- `dspy_7329144ef1e9` claim `c6` does not cite the row's strongest existing
  `DummyLM` evidence span; and
- `dspy_a5b116f00083` claim `c2` cites adapter mechanics but not the strongest
  available example of per-call `dspy.context(adapter=...)` scoping.

These are dataset-quality caveats. Editing them here would create a corrected
derivative and break exact-subset fidelity, so this run preserves and discloses
them.

## Studying and evaluation corpus

`corpora/smalldspy` is a reproducible sparse checkout of DSPy commit
`9cdb0aac28b2a04b064e40697ccd301872cf6a43`. Exactly 59 allowed Python files
(12,931 lines, 497,627 characters) are exposed through repository tools under:

- `dspy/adapters`
- `dspy/predict`
- `dspy/primitives`
- `tests/predict`

Setup creates or verifies those exact sparse roots. The validator accepts
`skip-worktree` only outside the configured roots, requires all in-scope files
to be normally indexed, and rechecks each exposed file's pinned blob and mode.
Neither study nor evaluation tools can read benchmark, run, grade, or experiment
files. Both arms use this same scoped corpus in every tool-enabled evaluation
budget; `direct` is intentionally tool-free in both arms.

## Frozen paired design

The design is an adaptive exploratory screen:

| field | frozen value |
|---|---|
| generator and local judge | `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` @ `c202236235762e1c871ad0ccb60c8ee5ba337b9a` |
| harness | author-confirmed `dspy.ReAct` implementation |
| arms | no note; exact forced-50 SmallDSPy note prepended |
| answer-time corpus access | `grep`, `glob`, and pinned `read_file` in both arms |
| budgets | `direct`, `k5`, `k20`, `k20f` |
| rollouts | 3 per question and budget; 60 episodes per arm |
| master seed | `44001` |
| paired seed group | `smalldspy-local-cheatsheet-screen-20260713` |
| judge evidence | dataset excerpts, identically in both arms |
| bootstrap | 10,000 paired replicates, seed `45001` |
| primary summary | pure-sum lenient WAUC for each arm |

The full baseline grid runs before the full treatment grid. This fixed ordering
is operationally simple but not counterbalanced, so time-dependent server or
hardware drift could be confounded with the arm contrast even though both runs
share one server lifecycle and every substantive recorded environment field.
This is another reason to treat the comparison as diagnostic only.

The treatment note is generated once by the existing forced-50 study protocol
over only the scoped corpus, without benchmark access. It is not the historical
full-DSPy `cheatsheets/dspy.md`. The immutable construction is
`studies/cheatsheet/smalldspy-cheatsheet-s50-20260713/smalldspy/`; evaluation
must supply both its content-addressed note and manifest. Study tokens are
reported separately and excluded from the evaluation token axis, matching the
paper's estimand.

The generator also serves as the local judge, so grading errors may be
correlated with generation behavior. Five questions provide very low precision,
and bootstrap intervals are descriptive on this adaptively selected population,
not a remedy for selection bias. Console output must retain the repository's
`EXPLORATORY LOCAL-QWEN PROXY: NOT CLAIM-READY` warning; report JSON must encode
`claim_ready=false` and the local-proxy provenance, and comparison JSON must
retain its diagnostic banner.

## Infrastructure preflight

On 2026-07-13, allocation `16142825` exposed seven idle L40S GPUs. The 262k
context requires TP=2 on this GPU class, so generation uses six GPUs as three
identical TP=2 servers; no scientifically different TP=1 seventh server is
introduced. Local grading uses one TP=2 server on two GPUs.

The first full-corpus launcher diagnostics exposed two pre-provider failures:
PyTorch 2.11 returns a typed CUDA UUID, and Hugging Face's offline repository-ID
loader rejected an inference-complete snapshot because `.gitattributes`,
`LICENSE`, and `README.md` were absent. The launcher now validates typed UUIDs,
byte-attests the exact local snapshot, passes that snapshot path directly to
vLLM, and preserves `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` as the served response identity. The fresh
`vllm-16142825-smalldspy-infra-a` preflight loaded all three servers, completed
warmup, passed authenticated `/models` readiness, re-attested the cache, and
cleanly released all GPU processes. No SmallDSPy question or study prompt was
sent during that infrastructure preflight.

Offline preflight passed 331 non-sandbox tests and 11 sandbox-environment tests,
compiled the Python tree in both pinned environments, syntax-checked every
shell launcher, reproduced the sparse checkout from a fresh local clone, passed
`git diff --check`, and confirmed `AGENTS.md` is byte-identical to `CLAUDE.md`.

## Execution namespaces and phase commands

The outcome-bearing source tree must be committed, pushed, and clean. A failed
smoke or full namespace is never deleted or reused; use a fresh suffix/ID.

Generation runs inside one six-GPU Slurm step and one authenticated server
lifecycle. It first runs a one-question baseline smoke, then the full forced-50
construction, then a one-question note-bearing smoke. Each gate is inspected
before sending the following commands in the same live step. Only then are the
two paired 60-episode grids run sequentially:

```bash
srun --jobid=16142825 --overlap --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 \
  --cpus-per-task=60 --cpu-bind=none --gres=gpu:l40s:6 \

After the generation step exits and all six server processes are confirmed
gone, a separate two-GPU Slurm step starts one fresh local judge. Grade one
smoke first, inspect it, then grade and report both complete populations before
the judge exits. Finally compare the two content-addressed reports with the
already frozen description `forced-50 scoped SmallDSPy cheatsheet versus no
note`:

```bash
srun --jobid=16142825 --overlap --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 \

```

The content-addressed report paths are resolved after reporting and supplied to
`studybench.screen_compare` with 10,000 paired bootstrap replicates and seed
`45001`. The comparison is an additional diagnostic artifact, not one of the
two requested primary numbers.

## Results

Pending. No SmallDSPy generation or grade outcome has been observed.
